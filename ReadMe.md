========================================================

This ``R`` code makes a line plot using 'xkcd' style graphics from the ``xkcd`` package used with ``ggplot2``. The data is included as a .csv file. You can change that to get the curves you want. It takes some fiddling to get it right, but once you have the code up and running you can just keep messing with it until the smoothed lines look the way you want them too. No promises on this working smoothly for you.

**IMPORTANT**: you must install the Humor Sans font on your computer and then import it to ``R``. Download the font here: http://xkcdsucks.blogspot.com/2009/03/xkcdsucks-is-proud-to-present-humor.html. Once you install the font on your computer, you import it into ``R`` using the ``import_font`` command as seen in the code.
